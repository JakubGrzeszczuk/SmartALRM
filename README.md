# SmartALRM

This is a smart alarm clock that you can control remotely from your phone. You can set the alarm time and choose a wake-up mission—like a quiz, shaking your phone, or counting steps—that you have to complete to turn the alarm off.

The device connects to the app via Bluetooth, and shows time on a small display, plays sound, and optionally lights up. The system is designed to make waking up more interactive and effective, combining a fun mobile app with a simple embedded alarm.

Firmware branch represents STM software made in STM32CubeIDE - this branch includes both tests of each used module and lastest version of successfully working alarm.

Android branch stands for mobile aplication layer used to control the alarm remotely.
