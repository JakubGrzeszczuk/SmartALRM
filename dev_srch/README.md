# This branch contains files which can be used as an device detector by searching an active COM ports

1. Connect the device by USB-UART
2. Use PuTTY in a serial mode with these parameters:
   -> baud rate: 115200
   -> data bits: 8
   -> parity: none
   -> stop bits: 1
   -> flow control: none
3. Open the terminal and the list with active ports should pop-up
